### Introduction
- Rather than explicitly modeling dynamics using reconstruction
- It aims to learn a maximally useful model which can predict outcomes conditioned on a sequence of actions.
- TD-MPC learns an implicit control-centric world model from environment interaction using a combination of joint-embedding prediction, reward prediction, and TD-learning without decoding observations.
