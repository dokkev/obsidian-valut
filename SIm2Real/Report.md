- Most robotic manipulation tasks have been limited to pick and place despite significant advancements in robotic hardware including computers, sensors, actuators, and perception and planning algorithms along with new machine learning techniques in past decades. 
- Matured computer vision technologies have enabled the rapid progression of robotic perception and the capability for sophisticated task and motion planning for a long horizon task combined with the new wave of using large language models for the robotic decision-making process. 
- Meanwhile, contact-rich manipulation remains a challenging problem due to the nature of high-dimensional and non-linear contact mechanics when the robot interacts closely with the environment.  
- This current in artificial intelligence struggles in the low level interaction with the environment
- Intelligence needs to be embodied into the system for robots to perform contact-rich manipulation tasks.
- Modeling contact is hard like mentioned, and most simulation approximate contact due to limited computation resources and make the simulation faster.
- This simulation to reality gap is aggravated in contact rich-manipulation tasks
