- Most robotic manipulation tasks have been limited to pick and place despite significant advancements in robotic hardware including computers, sensors, actuators, and perception and planning algorithms along with new machine learning techniques in past decades. 
- Matured computer vision technologies have enabled the rapid progression of robotic perception and the capability for sophisticated task and motion planning for a long horizon task combined with the new wave of using large language models for the robotic decision-making process. 
- Meanwhile, contact-rich manipulation remains a challenging problem due to the nature of high-dimensional and non-linear contact mechanics when the robot interacts closely with the environment.  
- This advancement in artifical intelligence struggles in the low level ineraction with the enviroment
