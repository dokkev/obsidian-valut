## CS224n: Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning
## Problem Definition
This tutorial includes comprehensive lectures of natural language processing (NLP) using RNN, GRUs, and LSTM networks. NLP models aim to compute the probability of occurrence of a sequence of words to perform tasks such as speech recognition. The author introduces how languages models predict the likelihood of word sequences from utilizing historical data to inform future predictions.
## Summary of the methodology presented: algorithm, input-output
RNNs, GRUs, and LSTMs are applied to NLP tasks such as text generation, sentiment analysis, language translation, and speech recognition. These models capture long-range dependencies within the text. RNN can handle sequences of any length by maintaining a hidden state that captures information from previous inputs. GRUs improve upon RNN by introducing gating mechanisms to control the flow of information. LSTMs which consist of input gate, forget fate, and output gate are designed to overcome RNN. LSTMs manage information flow through cell state to retain or forget information selectively. Bidirectional RSS process data in both directions, and Deep RRNs stack multiple layers of RNNs to enhance the model capacity.
## Applicability / Problems solved
These methods have significantly advanced the field of NLP by enabling more effective handling of sequential data, capturing long-range dependencies within the text, and improving the accuracy of predictive models in tasks such as machine translation and question-answering systems. They can be used in text generation, sentiment analysis, language translation, speech recognition, and more.

## Assumptions and limitations
The assumption that sequential data can be adequately modeled using these networks may not always hold, especially for highly complex or non-sequential data patterns. The document highlights issues such as the vanishing and exploding gradient problems that can affect the training of deep RNNs. Although GRUs and LSTMs mitigate some of these issues through their gating mechanisms, challenges in training efficiency and computational resources remain.
