강화학습에서의 평가/성능 지표
- Robustness
	- external force
	- ground variation
- Better performance
	- velocity tracking
	- faster motion

Opinion:
- Measuring robustness can be challenging. 
- Performance evaluation is challenging as well because it requires setting up different simulation environment. If commercial, the company may provide controllers (integrated into the robot)


RL environment involves an Agent and Environment. The Agent takes action based on the State
