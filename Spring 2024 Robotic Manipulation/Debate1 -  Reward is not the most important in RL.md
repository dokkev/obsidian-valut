## Key Concepts
- Exploitation:  a greedy approach in which agents try to get more rewards by using estimated value but not the actual value
- Â Exploration: agents primarily focus on improving their knowledge about each action instead of getting more rewards so that they can get long-term benefits.

## Arguments
- Reinforcement Learning process includes an agent takes an action which affects the environment, and the environments gives reward and provides state to the agent.
- But in reality, there are more layers when it comes to deploying policy trained from RL.
- Action goes into control input, which usually consists of high level controller and low level controller. 
- Then the robot physically interacts
