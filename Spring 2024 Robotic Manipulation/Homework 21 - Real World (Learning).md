## THE INGREDIENTS OF REAL-WORLD ROBOTIC REINFORCEMENT LEARNING
## Problem Definition
It is challenging to deploy autonomous learning robotic systems in real-world without episodic resets, which is a significant limitation o current robot learning algorithms. It is necessary for robots to learn from raw sensory inputs, e
