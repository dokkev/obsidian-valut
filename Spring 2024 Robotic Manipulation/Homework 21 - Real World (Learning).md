## THE INGREDIENTS OF REAL-WORLD ROBOTIC REINFORCEMENT LEARNING
## Problem Definition
It is challenging to deploy autonomous learning robotic systems in real-world without episodic resets, which is a significant limitation o current robot learning algorithms. It is necessary for robots to learn from raw sensory inputs, self-assign rewards, and operate continuously in non-episodic setting to effectively collect real-world data for generalization

## Why the state-of-the-art is not enough for this? Why does it fail?
Thhis method learns from non-episodic real-world settings, and the effectiveness of policies learned from reset-free environments is significantly limited due to reduced  

## What is the clever idea of this paper?
The paper proposes a system that learns directly from visual inputs without manual resets or engineered reward functions. Reset-free reinforcement learning uses a perturbation controller and unsupervised representation learning, and this approach enables the learning of complex behaviors in robots directly from raw sensory data, reducing the human interventions
## How the idea is implemented
The idea is implemented through a combination of vision-based reinforcement learning (RL) using actor-critic algorithms, a vision-based goal classifier for rewards, and reset-free learning. The system employs variational inverse control with events for reward specification and a variational autoencoder for handling visual observations. This allows the robot to learn and adapt its behavior based on its sensory inputs and the outcomes of its actions, effectively navigating the complexities of real-world tasks without pre-programmed resets.
##  How is success proved and measured?
This paper's method is evaluated through real-world tasks like valve rotation and bead manipulation, where policies trained with the proposed method achieved high success rates after hours of training without manual resets. The evaluation involved manually setting the environment to various initial configurations and measuring the success based on the proximity to the goal configurations.
