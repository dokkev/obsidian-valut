- Main benefit of using simulation for robot learning is to
	- improve sample efficiency
	- reduce the cost of data collection
- And having a fast simulation can benefit overall efficiency of data collection or training
- In robot learning, having a larger dataset is more important than having a good quality to avoid covariate shift and achieve task generalization. 
- To overcome lack of accuracy in simulation, numerous sim2real transfer techniques such as domain randomization and domain adaptation, meta-learning, and knowlege d
