- Main benefit of using simulation for robot learning is to
	- improve sample efficiency
	- reduce the cost of data collection
- And having a fast simulatio
- In robot learning, having a larger dataset is more important than having a good quality to avoid covariate shift and achieve task generalization. 
- To overcome lack of accuracy of
