## Problem Definition
The need for benchmark arises from the current limitations of robotics and AI in performing long-horizon tasks for human-centered tasks involving complex manipulations tasks. Despite existing benchmarks in simulation, there is a lack of a comprehensive benchmark that addresses the real world diversity of human needs and the physical realism necessary for training effective robots.
