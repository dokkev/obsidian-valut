## Problem Definition
The need for benchmark arises from the current limitations of robotics and AI in performing long-horizon tasks for human-centered tasks involving complex manipulations tasks. Despite existing benchmarks in simulation, there is a lack of a comprehensive benchmark that addresses the real world diversity of human needs such as activities that humans perform daily, from basic cleaning tasks to more complex interactions with a variety of objects and environment and the physics simulation which can accurately unecessary for training effective robots.

## Why the state-of-the-art is not enough for this? Why does it fail?

## What is the clever idea of this paper?

## How the idea is implemented
BEHAVIOR-1K comprises a diverse set of activities, scenes, and objects from physical and semantic properties.  OMNIGIBSON supports the simulation of these activities with realistic physics with various materials to enable complex interactions with environments.

##  How is success proved and measured?
Success is measured through experiments that evaluate reinforcement learning algorithms on several activities within BEHAVIOR-1K by evaluating success rates, efficiency, and sim-to-real gap analysis.
