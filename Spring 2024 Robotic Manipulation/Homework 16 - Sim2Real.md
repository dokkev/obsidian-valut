## In-Hand Object Rotation via Rapid Motor Adaptation

## Problem Definition
Compared to human's ability to manipulate different objects in-hand, generalized in-hand manipulation to robot has been an unsolved challenge. Traditional method has demonstrated in-hand manipulation of limited objects using multi-fingered hands, highlighting the complexity of generalized robotic in-hand manipulation.

## Why the state-of-the-art is not enough for this? Why does it fail?

## What is the clever idea of this paper?
This method divides action and percept

## How the idea is implemented
The controller is trained using reinforcement (PPO) in a simulated environment to learn the representation of the objects' extrinsic parameters and optimize the joint control policy. 
The base policy is trained with object properties. Then the adaptation module is trained to infer a low-dimensional embedding of the objectâ€™s properties such as size and mass from revision joint angles and action history, which is then used by the base policy to rotate the object.

##  How is success proved and measured?
