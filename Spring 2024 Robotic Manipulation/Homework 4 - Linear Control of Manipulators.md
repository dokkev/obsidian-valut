## Problem Definition
Dynamics of a manipulator are represented by a nonlinear differential equation. However, linear control systems with approximations are widely used in industrial robot manipulators. 

## Summary of the methodology presented: algorithm, input-output
The methodology involves modeling a robotic manipulator with actuators which can produce torque at each joint and sensors using feedback control with second-order linear system. The controllers take desired trajectory and state (configuration) of the robot and outputs motion.

## Applicability / Problems solved 
This method is applicable to trajectory following
