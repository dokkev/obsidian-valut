## Problem Definition
Dynamics of a manipulator are represented by a nonlinear differential equation. However, linear control systems with approximations are widely used in industrial robot manipulators. 

## Summary of the methodology presented: algorithm, input-output
The methodology involves modeling a robotic manipulator with actuators which can produce torque at each joint and sensors
