# Markov Decision Processes, Intro to RL
## Problem Definition
Challenges in Robotic decision-making address that sequences of decisions must be made and uncertainty may exist in the environment. . The deterministic approach assumes a known outcome for each action, while the stochastic method accounts for uncertainty in outcomes, using probabilities to model various possible future states​​.
