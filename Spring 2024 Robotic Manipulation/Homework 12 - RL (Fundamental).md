# Markov Decision Processes, Intro to RL
## Problem Definition
Challenges in Robotic decision-making address that sequences of decisions must be made and uncertainty may exist in the environment. . The deterministic approach assumes a known outcome for each action, while the stochastic method accounts for uncertainty in outcomes, using probabilities to model various possible future states​​.

## Summary of the methodology presented: algorithm, input-output
**Deterministic DP** involves a sequence of decisions, modeled as a discrete-time system where the state transition depends on the current state and action. The objective is to minimize a cost function over a finite planning horizon. This approach uses backward recursion and the principle of optimality to compute the optimal control sequence​​.
