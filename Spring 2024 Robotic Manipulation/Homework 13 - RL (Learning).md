# End-to-End Training of Deep Visuomotor Policies

## Problem Definition
Designing the perception and control software for autonomous operation is challenging. While DNN shows successfull applications in comupte
## Why the state-of-the-art is not enough for this? Why does it fail?

## What is the clever idea of this paper?
The authors combine perception system and control policy. 

## How the idea is implemented

##  How is success proved and measured?
