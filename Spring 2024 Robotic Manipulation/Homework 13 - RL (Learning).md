# End-to-End Training of Deep Visuomotor Policies

## Problem Definition
Designing the perception and control software for autonomous operation is challenging. While DNN with large amout of data and direction supervision shows successful applications in computer vision and speech recognition, 
## Why the state-of-the-art is not enough for this? Why does it fail?

## What is the clever idea of this paper?
The authors combine perception system and control policy. 

## How the idea is implemented

##  How is success proved and measured?
