### In-Hand Object Rotation via Rapid Motor Adaption

### Motivation
- In-hand manipulation (IHM) is the ability to move an object in your and using only thumb and fingers
- Hand controllers are much harder to develop because the implicit changes in movement need to occur
### Problem setting
Given an object, use a robot to rotate the object along z-axis only by joint positions and commanded actions.
