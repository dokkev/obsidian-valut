## Lessons from the Amazon Picking Challenge: Four Aspects of Building Robotic Systems

## Problem Definition
The Amazon Picking Challenge tested the ability of a robotic system to autonomously pick the ordered items from a warehouse shelf. This paper describes the winning entry to this competition and how they approached manipulation problems in real world unstructured environments.
## Summary of the methodology presented: algorithm, input-output
The winning system's methodology is characterized by its approach to system building along four key aspects, each offering a spectrum of solutions.
Modularity vs. Integration: Emphasizes the importance of system integration over individual module performance, advocating for a balance between modularity for problem simplification and integration for effective system behavior.
Computation vs. Embodiment: Suggests that robot behavior emerges from both computation (software) and embodiment (hardware), recommending a blend where hardware adjustments can lead to simple, robust solutions.
Planning vs. Feedback: Highlights the trade-off between planning (searching in a world model for verifiable solutions) and feedback (reducing uncertainty through physical interaction), with a preference for feedback when global search is not necessary.
Generality vs. Assumptions: Discusses the need for general solutions while acknowledging the importance of making reasonable assumptions to tackle manipulation challenges in unstructured environments effectively.
