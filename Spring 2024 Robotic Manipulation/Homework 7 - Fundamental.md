## Integrated Task and Motion Planning (TAMP) in robotics

## Problem Definition
The author addresses translating abstract plans defined in PDDL into feasible actions in the real world where obstacles and hardware limitation exists. Task planning grow exponentially with the size of the problem. 

## Summary of the methodology presented: algorithm, input-output
TAMP incorporates both task

## Applicability / Problems solved

## Assumptions and limitations
