## Integrated Task and Motion Planning (TAMP) in robotics

## Problem Definition
The author addresses translating abstract plans defined in PDDL into feasible actions in the real world where obstacles and hardware limitation exists. Task planning grow exponentially with the size of the problem. 

## Summary of the methodology presented: algorithm, input-output
TAMP incorporates both task and motion planning into a combined framework which requires more upfront computation but provides safer robot behaviors. In detail, hierarchical planning techniques and sampling-based strategies are combined to accept high level goals, environments, and robot state as inputs and to output a sequence of actions and specific motions to achieve desired goals.
