### Fundamentals of Grasping
#### Problem definition (2-3 sentences)
Grasping is challenging due to its high-dimensionality, complexity of contact, risk of collision, and requirement to relatively evaluate the quality of the grasping. 

#### Summary of the methodology presented: algorithm, input-output. (1-2 sentences)
The author introduces mathematical modeling of frictionless point contact, point contact with friction, soft-finger contact. The wrench term can be used to evaluate the grasping, and 
#### Applicability / Problems solved (2-3 sentences)

#### Assumptions and limitations (1-2 sentences)
The method assumes the center of the mass of an object and desired wrench are known.
