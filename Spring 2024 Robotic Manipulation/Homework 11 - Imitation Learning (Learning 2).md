## Problem Definition
The author addresses challenges in collecting real-world data, which is significant for training models which can generalize tasks. Traditional data collection for robotics involves task specific data collection, which do not leverage learning from large and various datasets. In addition, task generalization requires a high capacity model such as transformer. However, robotic controllers can't be run real-time with it sufficiently.
