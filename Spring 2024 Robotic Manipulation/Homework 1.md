## An overview of dexterous manipulation, Okamura and Cutkosky, 

#### challenges
- Dexterous Manipulation (DM) requires precise control of forces and motions with robotic hands with fingers.
#### limitations
- Lack of adequate tactile sensing.

#### Solved Problems
- Kinemaic/Dynamic model based manipulation in controlled enviromentsn 
- Grasp Jacobian calculates the required fingertip forces from desired wrench term to the object while Hand Jacobian maps the relationship between the contact force of the fingertip and joint torques. 

#### Assumptions
Future dexterous robotic manipulation will include tasks which are iunfeeasbile or dangerous for a human 


- solved problems
