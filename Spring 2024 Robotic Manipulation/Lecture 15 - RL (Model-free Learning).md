### Technical Problems
- High dimensionality
- Large number of potential contacts
- complex and discontinuous contact patterns
### Prior Work Failure
- DRL: unscalable and inefficient sampling
- Model-based approaches: require accurate models and state estimates

### Proposed Approach
- Demo Augumented Po
