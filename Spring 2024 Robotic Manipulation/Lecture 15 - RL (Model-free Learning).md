### Technical Problems
- High dimensionality
- Large number of potential contacts
- complex and discontinuous contact patterns
### Prior Work Failure
- DRL: unscalable and inefficient sampling
- Model-based approaches: require accurate models and state estimates

### Proposed Approach
- Demo Augmented Policy Gradient (DAPG)
- Model the control problem as MDP
- Natural Policy Gradient
- Augmenting RL with demonstrations:
	- Alleviated the need for laborious reward shaping
	- Decreases sample complexity
	-
