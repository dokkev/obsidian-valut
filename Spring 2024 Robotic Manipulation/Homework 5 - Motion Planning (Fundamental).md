## Problem Definition
Motion planning involves geometrically parametrizing the robot's state and its environment to synthesize
Motion planning deals with enabling a robot to find a way to move from a starting point to a goal point without collision. Motion planning problem have to be discretized for computation despite its continuity in C-space.
