## Problem Definition
Motion planning involves geometrically parametrizing the robot's state and its environment to synthesize its movement while avoiding collision. Although combinatorial solutions provided theoretical solutions, it was impractical due to computation limitation of high-dimensionality and complex configurations

## Summary of the methodology presented: algorithm, input-output
The configuration of the robot and obstacle in the environment can be represented as C-space, which represents all possible configuration of the robot. The motion planner takes initial and desired goal position and outputs collision-free path
