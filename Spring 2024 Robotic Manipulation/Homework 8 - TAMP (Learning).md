## Problem Definition
Language models lack real-world experience, which makes decision-making within a given embodiment challenging.  Since LLMs are not grounded in the physical world with no observation of the consequences of their generated actions, it can cause unsafe and unreasonable actions in physical worlds. Therefore, this limits for robots to leverage LLMs for decision-making process involving physical tasks in the real world.
