# Model-based and Model-free RL for Robot Control
## Problem Definition
Dynamic programming suffers from practical challenges such as the curse of dimensionality and performance in unknown environments. Therefore, the author introduces reinforcement learning, which can solve a more general problem optimally within an unknown environment. 

## Summary of the methodology presented: algorithm, input-output
RL includes the state and control input for the system

## Applicability / Problems solved


## Assumptions and limitations
