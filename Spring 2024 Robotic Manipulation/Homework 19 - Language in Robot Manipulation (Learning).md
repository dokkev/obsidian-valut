## MUTEX: Learning Unified Policies from Multimodal Task Specifications

## Problem Definition
Humans use different modalities such as speech, text, images, videos, etc. to effectively communicate, and the author addresses the challenge of developing policies that can reason about multimodal task specifications for diverse manipulation tasks. Each task is defined in a single modality that changes from task to task, leveraging the strengths of different modalities like goal descriptions and step-by-step video demonstrations to improve the modelâ€™s ability to execute tasks specified in different modalities

## Why the state-of-the-art is not enough for this? Why does it fail?
This method assumes that 

## What is the clever idea of this paper?
This method can provide unified policies capable of reasoning about multimodal task specifications for diverse manipulation tasks. This involves leveraging the complementary strengths of different modalities and improving the robustness of task execution for every single modality.

## How the idea is implemented
The idea is implemented through a two-stage training procedure that includes Mask Modeling and Cross-Modal Matching, combined with a behavior cloning objective for policy learning to foster cross-modal interactions. This improves each modality with information from the information-denser one to ensure the learned representation contains relevant information for the agent to perform the manipulation task.
##  How is success proved and measured?
The experiments and results include comprehensive evaluations on a newly constructed dataset of multimodal task specifications. The model's performance is compared to modality-specific models and evaluated across different modalities to demonstrate the improved performance over methods trained specifically for any single modality. This includes evaluating the task specification representations learned by MUTEX and its ability to execute tasks with a single specification in any of the learned modalities or with multiple specifications in several of the modalities
