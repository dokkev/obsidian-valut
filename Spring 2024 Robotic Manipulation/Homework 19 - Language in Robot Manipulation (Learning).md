## MUTEX: Learning Unified Policies from Multimodal Task Specifications

## Problem Definition
Humans use different modalities such as speech, text, images, videos, etc. to effectively communicate, and the author addresses the challenge of developing policies that can reason about multimodal task specifications for diverse manipulation tasks. Each task is defined in a single modality that changes from task to task, leveraging the strengths of different modalities like goal descriptions and step-by-step video demonstrations to improve the model’s ability to execute tasks specified in different modalities
