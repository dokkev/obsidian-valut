When we talk about general-purpose robots. It usually requires two features:
First one is generalization and the second one is adaptability. I argue that solely scaling imitation learning does not guarantee the robot policy is able to generalize task and adapt to dynamic environment.

The first reason is 

- Standard teleoperation devices lack of tactile and proprioceptive sensing modalities. 


- Dilemma of transferability
	- Kinesthetic teaching enables proprioceptive perception
