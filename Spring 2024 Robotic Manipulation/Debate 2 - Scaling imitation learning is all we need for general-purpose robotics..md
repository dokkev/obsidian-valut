When we talk about general-purpose robots. It usually requires two features:
First one is generalization and the second one is adaptability. I argue that solely scaling imitation learning does not guarantee the robot policy is able to generalize task and adapt to dynamic environment.

The first reason is 

- Standard teleoperation devices lack of tactile and proprioceptive sensing modalities. 


- Dilemma of transferability
	- Kinesthetic teaching enables proprioceptive perception from the expert's demonstration, but the effectiveness of this method is limited to the physical capabilities of the robot in terms of force, torque, and tactile sensing.
