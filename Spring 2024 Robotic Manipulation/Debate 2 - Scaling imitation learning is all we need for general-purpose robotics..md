When we talk about general-purpose robots. It usually requires two features:
First one is generalization and the second one is adaptability. I argue that solely scaling imitation learning does not guarantee the robot policy is able to genealize task and adapt to dynamic environment.

- Standard teleoperation devices lack of tactile and proprioceptive sensing modalities.
