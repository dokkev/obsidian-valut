When we talk about general-purpose robots. It usually requires three features:
First one is generalization,  the second one is adaptability, and the thrid one is safety. I argue that solely scaling imitation learning does not guarantee the robot policy is able to generalize task and adapt to dynamic environment safely.

The first reason is 

- Standard teleoperation devices lack of tactile and proprioceptive sensing modalities. 

There have been many attempts at generalization method such as Inverse RL, Meta Learning, Multi-Task Learning, Transfer Learning, Multi-Task RL, Lifelong Learning, and continual learning. However, those approaches have no emphasis on control-theoretical guarantees such as 


- Dilemma of transferability
	- Kinesthetic teaching enables proprioceptive perception from the expert's demonstration, but the effectiveness of this method is limited to the physical capabilities of the robot in terms of force, torque, and tactile sensing. 


## Terminology
### Control-theoretical guarantees 
assurances provided within the framework of control theory, which ensure that a control system behaves as expected under certain conditions.
1. **Stability**: 
2. **Convergence**: 
3. **Robustness**:nificant degradation in performance.
4. **Optimality**:
5. **Safety**: Safety 
6. **Reachability and Controllability**:
