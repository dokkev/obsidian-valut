"A system that learns without human intervention is better than one with human intervention."

- In terms of autonomous system that runs policies trained from machine learning,
- I would like to argue that policies with minimum human intervention tend to be more optimal and generalizable. 
- The reasons are scalability of the system, elimination of human bias, and cost reduction.


## Scalability of the system
- This is also addressed in the paper today. Using reinforcement learning without human intervention can continuously improve the policy. It assigns rewards to their own trials and autonomously collects large amount of real-world data.
- unsupervised learning, can continuously adapt to new data or environments without the need for constant human oversight.
- Autonomous systems can be designed to continuously learn and improve from new data, leading to progressively better performance over time. This is in contrast to systems requiring human intervention, where updates or improvements may be implemented more slowly due to the need for human analysis and decision-making


## Eliminating Human Bias
- Human intervention introduces  human bias during data handling and decision making processes..
- autonomous learning systems can make decisions based on data and predefined algorithms, leading to more objective and consistent outcomes.
- autonomous systems are not limited by human preconceptions or existing knowledge and can therefore explore a broader range of solutions to a given problem
- One famous example is from Nature journal, called Mastering the game of Go without human knowledge. AlphaGo Zero is trained solely on reinforcement learning without human data. As a result, AlphaGo Zero achieved super human performance defeating AlphaGo.
