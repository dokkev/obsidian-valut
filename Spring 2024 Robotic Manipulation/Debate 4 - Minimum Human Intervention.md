"A system that learns without human intervention is better than one with human intervention."

- In terms of autonomous system that runs policies trained from machine learning,
- I would like to argue that policies with minimum human intervention tend to be more optimal and generalizable. 
- The reasons are scalability of the system, elimination of human bias, and cost reduction.


## Scalability of the system
- This is also addressed in the paper today. Using reinforcement learning without human intervention can continuously improve the policy. It assigns rewards to their own trials and autonomously collects large amount of real-world data.
- It's more efficient to handle high-dimensional and large amout of data
