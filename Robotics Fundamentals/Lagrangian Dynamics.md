- Forward Dynamics:
	- Given $\theta, \dot{\theta}$, and, $\tau$, find $\ddot{\theta}$
- Inverse Dynamics
	-  Given $\theta, \dot{\theta}$, and, $\ddot{\theta}$, find  $\tau$

There are two approaches forward and inverse dynamics problems:
- Lagrangian formulation - variational approach based on kinetic and potential energy of the robot
-
