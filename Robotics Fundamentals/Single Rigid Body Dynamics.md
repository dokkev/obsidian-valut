A rigid body can be considered as a collection of point masses that are rigidly attached. We define the COM to be the unique point at the centroid of the mass distribution. 
- where point mass $i$ has mass, $m_{i}$ and total mass is $m = \sum{m_i}$
- Let $r_{i}= (x_{i},y_{i},z_{i})$  be the fixed location of mass $i$ in a body frame {$b$}
- The origin of this frame is the unique point such that

- This point is known as COM. 

Let's assume that the body is moving with a body twist $V_{b}$ , and let $p_{i}(t)$ be the time-varying position of $m_{i}$ 
- $V_{b} = (\omega_{b}, v_{b})$

- Where $$f_{b}= m(\dot{v_{b}} + [\omega_{b}]v_{b})$$
$$ m_{b} = I_b+\dot{\omega_{b}}$$
