- Equality constraint needs to be affine constraint (can't be quadratic)
- Where $f_{0} ... f_{m}$ are convex functions, feasible set is convex, and the objective function is convex as well
- On the other hand, it may be not true
- If tour feasible set and object function are convex, the problem may not be convex
