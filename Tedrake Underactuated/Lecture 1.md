## Goals for the class
- Bring together tools from
	- Nonlinear dynamics
	- Optimization
	- Control
	- Machine Learning
- Rigorous thinking about "model systems"
- Algorithmic toolkit for more complex systems

- Atlas is mostly ⇾  online planning using with mechanics
- ANYmal / Quadrupeds → Reinforcement Learning
- Manipulation → Imitation Learning dominantly
