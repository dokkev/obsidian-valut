## Goals for the class
- Bring together tools from
	- Nonlinear dynamics
	- Optimization
	- Control
	- Machine Learning
- Rigorous thinking about "model systems"
- Algorithmic toolkit for more complex systems

- Atlas is mostly using online planning using
- ANYmal / Quadrupeds use RL
- Manipulation -> Imitation Learning d
