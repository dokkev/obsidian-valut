### Contact Model of Soft Finger
- gamma is torsional fiction coefficient
- tau_normal has to be lesser than gamma * fz. Why
### Grasp Wrench Space, W
- set of all possible wrenches w that can be applied to the object through admissible forces
- W determines robustness of grasp.
- Location of force applied does not matter to a rigid body
### Grasp Evaluation
- Grasp closure occurs when the grasp can be maintained for every possible disturbance load
- For closure (power grasp)
	- the gripper joint angles locked
	- kinematically constrained
