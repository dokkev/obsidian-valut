## Know your audience
- You should aim for your target audience to understand everything you say in a talk
- Even if you are targeting experts (e.g., your research advisor or peers), experts haven’t been thinking about your problem 60 hours a week
## Every Sentence Matters
- What are you trying to say? What technical story are you trying to tell? What is the point you are trying to make?
- Is what you just said making that point? (If not, remove it)
- If you can’t justify how it will help the listener, take it out. If it won’t be understood, take it out
- Too many talks have introductions and related work that suggest little thought was put into them - Which is bad — those are critical parts of the talk! 
 - Example of useless intro in 2023: 
	 - “LLMs have been shown to have good task performance on a variety of tasks…” 
		 - Everyone knows. So don’t say it
 - The goal of the intro and background is to tell the listener:
	 - “In this talk, here is the way I want you to think about the problem I am trying to solve.”
 - Don't include related works with just title and authors:

	 - Experts likely know these papers exist. These slides don’t tell them what about these papers is most relevant to this talk
