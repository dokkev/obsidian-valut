## Know your audience
- You should aim for your target audience to understand everything you say in a talk
- Even if you are targeting experts (e.g., your research advisor or peers), experts haven’t been thinking about your problem 60 hours a week
## Every Sentence Matters
- What are you trying to say? What technical story are you trying to tell? What is point you are trying to make?
- Is what you just said making that point? (If not, remove it)
- If you can’t justify how it will help the listener, take it out. If it won’t be understood, take it out
- Too many talks have introductions and related work that suggest little thought was put into them - Which is bad — those are critical parts of the talk! - Example of useless intro in 2023: “LLMs have been shown to have good task performance on a variety of tasks…” Everyone knows. So don’t say it
