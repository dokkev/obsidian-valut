### Introduction
- While past robotics have focused on rapid and accurate pick-and-place position control in controlled environments, future mobile robots must be capable to manager broader dynamic and force-critical interactions in unstructured environments. 
- Legged locomotion involves repeating dynamic events such as impact, high-force interactions with uncertain terrain, and rapid leg swing. 
- Such things make designing EM actuators challenging. 
- Design processes of EM were tra
