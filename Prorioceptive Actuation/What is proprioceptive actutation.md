Proprioceptive actuation has been used in haptic devices. (Kenneth Salisbury). It aims to maximize torque density and minimal mechanical impedance by focusing on inertia distribution design and eliminating force-torque sensor feedback. 

Typical manipulators approach objects in slow manner, unlike human moves in high acceleration. In that case, inertial force dominates in contact.  That inertia force is dominated by rotor inertia, gears, bearing, etc. Friction in gears are proportional to the force input (contact force input).
